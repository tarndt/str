This is an experimental string package that imagines strings in Go as a complex (non-primitive) type. The purpose of it's creation is to facilitate my own private experimentation and development of an experience report to evaluate if the value added by a package like this is significant enough to warrant the complexity of its existence. 

## Caveats

* Use at your own risk. No stability or defect guarantees are made and, unless this experiment proves fruitful
* This project may end up abandoned.

Those caveats aside, if you choose to use this, feedback and thoughts in the form of pull requests or issues are welcome.

## Future

* TODO: Further unit tests will be added if the experiment has initial positive returns.
* TODO: Better comments will be added if the experiment has initial positive returns.
